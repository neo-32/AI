## 1. Arithmetic & Pre-Algebra: Your Foundation

**Why this matters:** All higher math builds on these basics. ML/AI often deals with operations on numbers, fractions, decimals, percentages, and negative values. Make sure you’re comfortable here so you won’t struggle later.

- **Arithmetic course**:  
  - [Arithmetic on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic)  
  - Covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, place value, exponents, and more.  
- **Pre-Algebra course**:  
  - [Pre-Algebra on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra)  
  - Focus on:  
    - **Fractions, decimals, and percentages** (converting between them, arithmetic)  
    - **Negative numbers** and absolute value  
    - **Introduction to variables** (basic equations)  

**When to move on:** If you can comfortably handle fractions/decimals, negative numbers, and can solve simple equations with \(x\), you’re ready for Algebra.

## 2. Algebra: Working With Equations & Functions

**Why this matters:** Algebra is the language of formulas. ML/AI uses algebraic equations to describe how inputs map to outputs (models), how to solve for unknowns (parameters), and more.

- **Algebra 1 course**:  
  - [Algebra 1 on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra)  
  - Key areas to master:  
    - **Solving equations/inequalities** (linear, some basic systems)  
    - **Functions and graphs** (understand function notation, plot lines)  
    - **Linear equations** (reinforces the concept of slope, intercept)  
- **Algebra 2 course** *(selected parts)*:  
  - [Algebra 2 on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2)  
  - Focus on:  
    - **Exponential and logarithmic functions** (important for logistic regression, neural nets, etc.)  
    - Optionally explore **quadratic functions** (helps understand convexity/optimization).  
  - *(You can skip complex numbers, detailed polynomial factorization, etc., if they aren’t of interest.)*

**When to move on:** Once you’re comfortable with linear equations, function notation, exponentials/logs, and can solve basic systems of equations, move on to geometry & trig.

## 3. Geometry (Essentials Only)

**Why this matters:** ML often represents data as points in space, so understanding *distances* and the coordinate plane is key. You only need the basics of coordinate geometry and the Pythagorean theorem—no need for full geometry proofs here.

- **Coordinate geometry & Distance**:  
  - [Distance formula (coordinate geometry)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-analytic-geometry/hs-geo-distance-and-midpoints/a/distance-formula)  
  - Practice computing the distance between two points: useful for algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors.  
- **Pythagorean theorem review** *(if needed)*:  
  - [Intro to the Pythagorean theorem](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry/hs-geo-trig/hs-geo-pythagorean/a/intro-to-the-pythagorean-theorem)  

**When to move on:** If you can calculate distances in the coordinate plane and comfortably plot points, move to trigonometry.

---

## 4. Trigonometry (Focus on Sine, Cosine, Radians)

**Why this matters:** Sine and cosine show up in ML for similarity measures (cosine similarity) and in some advanced architectures (like positional encoding in Transformers).

- **Radians, unit circle, sine/cosine**:  
  - [Trigonometry on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry)  
  - Focus on the **unit circle definition** of sine and cosine, and **radian measure**.  
- Understand how **cosine** can measure the angle between vectors → **cosine similarity** in ML.  

**When to move on:** Once you know how to find sin/cos of an angle (in degrees or radians) and get the basic idea of trig functions, you’re set. Let’s jump to probability & stats!

---

## 5. Probability & Statistics: Data and Uncertainty

**Why this matters:** ML is fundamentally about data and uncertainty. You must know how to summarize data (mean, variance) and reason about probabilities (like a model’s prediction confidence).

- **Statistics & Probability course**:  
  - [Statistics and Probability on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability)  
  - Prioritize:  
    - **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, standard deviation)  
    - **Basic probability** (independence, conditional probability)  
    - **Random variables & distributions** (especially **normal distribution**)  

**When to move on:** If you can interpret data (mean, variance), compute basic probabilities, and understand what a normal distribution is, you’re ready for the backbone of ML: **linear algebra**.

---

## 6. Linear Algebra: Vectors & Matrices for ML

**Why this matters:** Modern ML and AI rely on vectors and matrices to represent data, parameters, and transformations. Neural networks are basically big matrix multiplications plus nonlinearities.

- **Linear Algebra course**:  
  - [Linear Algebra on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)  
  - Core topics to master:  
    - **Vectors** (addition, scalar multiplication, dot product)  
    - **Matrices** (addition, multiplication, inverses)  
    - **Systems of linear equations** in matrix form  
    - **Linear transformations** (how a matrix transforms space)  
    - **Eigenvalues & eigenvectors** (useful for concepts like PCA)  

**When to move on:** You can proceed when you’re comfortable with matrix multiplication, the concept of a linear transformation, and can at least *conceptually* grasp eigenvectors. Next up: calculus!

## 7. Calculus: Derivatives and Optimization

**Why this matters:** Training ML models (like neural networks) uses derivatives (gradients) to optimize parameters. You’ll see calculus everywhere in AI whenever you talk about “gradient descent.”

- **Differential Calculus**:  
  - [Differential Calculus on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-calculus)  
  - Focus on:  
    - **Limits** (basic idea) and continuity  
    - **Derivatives** (power rule, product rule, chain rule)  
    - **Finding minima/maxima** (set derivative = 0)  
- **Integral Calculus** (essentials):  
  - [Integral Calculus on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/integral-calculus)  
  - Learn basic **antiderivatives** and the **fundamental theorem of calculus**.  
  - (Deep integration techniques are optional for ML.)  

**When to move on:** If you can compute derivatives of standard functions, use the chain rule, and find minima by setting derivative=0, you’re set. We’ll extend that to multivariable next.

## 8. Multivariable Calculus: Gradients in Many Dimensions

**Why this matters:** ML models have multiple parameters, so we need partial derivatives (gradients) to do **gradient descent** in high-dimensional spaces.

- **Multivariable Calculus**:  
  - [Multivariable Calculus on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus)  
  - Key areas:  
    - **Partial derivatives**  
    - **Gradient vectors** (collect all partial derivatives)  
    - **Finding maxima/minima** in multiple variables  
- You can skip advanced integrals (like triple integrals) unless you’re curious.

**When to move on:** You’re ready when you can handle partial derivatives of functions of 2-3 variables and understand the gradient as the direction of steepest ascent. Next: an optional detour into differential equations.

## 9. (Optional) Differential Equations

**Why this matters (optionally):** Not strictly required for standard ML, but if you’re diving into **continuous-time** models, advanced optimization analysis, physics-based AI, or certain aspects of reinforcement learning, differential equations can be handy.

- **Differential Equations**:  
  - [Differential Equations on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)  
  - Focus on **first-order ODEs** (like \(\frac{dy}{dx} = ky\)) and conceptual solutions.  
  - Learn the idea that an ODE describes how a function changes over time (ties into continuous analogs of training).

**Feel free to skip if you’re not specifically interested in these areas**—you already have the main math for most ML topics.

## 10. Mathematical Reasoning & Logic (Tie It All Together)

**Why this matters:** ML/AI involves applying math to real-world problems, so you need clear logic, problem-solving skills, and the ability to decide which math tool applies.

- **Revisit function concepts** in Algebra/Precalculus sections to solidify domain/range, compositions, and transformations.  
  - [Functions (Algebra 1)](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:functions)  
- **Practice logical problem-solving** with word problems and “challenge” exercises in Algebra/Statistics.  
  - [Reasoning with linear equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra/x2f8bb11595b61c86:solve-equations-inequalities/x2f8bb11595b61c86:linear-equations-parentheses/e/reasoning-with-linear-equations)  

Use these to sharpen your thinking process, which is crucial in ML when deciding how to set up a model or interpret results.

# Final Thoughts

1. **Study Pace:** Go step by step. Don’t rush; it’s better to fully absorb each skill.  
2. **Practice:** Use the **quizzes** and **exercises** in each Khan Academy unit. Doing problems is the best way to reinforce learning.  
3. **Revisit Topics:** Math is cumulative. If you get stuck in calculus because of weak algebra, revisit the relevant algebra sections.  
4. **Apply to ML:** As you learn each concept, try to connect it to an ML scenario. For example, matrix multiplication → neural network layers; derivatives → gradient descent; probability → model evaluation.  
5. **Keep Going!** Once you feel comfortable with these essentials, you’ll be ready for hands-on ML courses, deep learning, and advanced AI concepts like Transformers and agentic AI systems.

Good luck, and enjoy your math journey on Khan Academy! You’ve got this!
