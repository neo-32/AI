# Step-by-Step Khan Academy Path

Below is a **step-by-step** Khan Academy learning path that will take you from the most basic math refreshers up to Precalculus, ensuring no gaps if you’ve “forgotten everything” from high school. This path aligns with the broader plan to eventually tackle _OpenStax Precalculus_, linear algebra, and calculus for machine learning and LLMs.

## Overview of the Khan Academy Path

1. **Arithmetic (Basic Math)**
2. **Pre-Algebra**
3. **Algebra 1**
4. **Geometry** (basic familiarity)
5. **Algebra 2**
6. **Trigonometry**
7. **Precalculus**

> **Note**: Depending on your current level, you might skip or move more quickly through certain steps. If you’re truly starting fresh, follow the whole sequence for a solid foundation.

## Step 1: Arithmetic (Basic Math)

- **Khan Academy Domain**: [Arithmetic](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic)  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (including fractions and decimals)  
  - Place value, basic word problems, ratios, percentages

**Goal**:  
- Rebuild confidence with fundamental operations  
- Be comfortable handling fractions, decimals, and negative numbers

---

## Step 2: Pre-Algebra

- **Khan Academy Course**: [Pre-algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra)  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Exponents, square roots, prime factorization  
  - Basic algebraic expressions and simple linear equations  
  - Ratios, proportions, introductory probability/percents

**Goal**:  
- Transition from arithmetic to algebraic thinking  
- Practice manipulating expressions (e.g., `x + 2`, `3x - 4`) and solving simple 1-step or 2-step equations

---

## Step 3: Algebra 1

- **Khan Academy Course**: [Algebra 1](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra)  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Linear equations & inequalities  
  - Functions (domain, range, function notation)  
  - Systems of equations (two or more linear equations)  
  - Polynomials, factoring, quadratic equations

**Goal**:  
- Gain comfort with fundamental algebraic manipulations (factoring polynomials, solving quadratics)  
- Understand how to graph linear and quadratic functions

---

## Step 4: Geometry (Basic Familiarity)

- **Khan Academy Course**: [Geometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/geometry)  
- **Focus On**:  
  - Basic shapes, angles, triangle properties  
  - Coordinate geometry (distance formula, midpoint, slope in geometric contexts)

**Goal**:  
- Know enough geometry to support trigonometry (right triangles, angles, circle definitions)  
- (Optional) Deeper geometry proofs are not strictly necessary unless you want them

---

## Step 5: Algebra 2

- **Khan Academy Course**: [Algebra 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2)  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Advanced polynomials, complex numbers  
  - Exponential and logarithmic functions (very important for calculus)  
  - Advanced quadratics, conic sections

**Goal**:  
- Get comfortable with exponents and logs  
- Work with complex numbers (understanding `i`, real vs. imaginary parts)  
- Strengthen understanding of advanced functions (transformations, inverses)

---

## Step 6: Trigonometry

There are two ways to cover trig in Khan Academy:

1. **Within Algebra 2**: Some states/courses include basic trig in Algebra 2.  
2. **Dedicated “Trigonometry” Course**: [Khan Academy Trigonometry](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/trigonometry)

- **Key Topics**:  
  - Unit circle definitions (sine, cosine, tangent)  
  - Basic trig identities (e.g., `sin²θ + cos²θ = 1`)  
  - Graphing trig functions (amplitude, period)  
  - Right triangle definitions (SOH-CAH-TOA)

**Goal**:  
- Understand angles, triangles, and the unit circle  
- Handle basic trig manipulations and identities

---

## Step 7: Precalculus

- **Khan Academy Course**: [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus)  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Polynomials, rational functions, advanced trigonometry  
  - Exponential/logarithmic review at a deeper level  
  - Sequences, series, intro to limits (in some sections)  
  - Vectors, parametric equations (sometimes included)

**Goal**:  
- Prepare fully for calculus  
- By the end, you’ll be ready to read _OpenStax Precalculus_ or jump straight to calculus/linear algebra

## After Precalculus: Moving Toward Machine Learning Math

- **Linear Algebra (Khan Academy)**: [Linear Algebra Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)  
- **Calculus (Khan Academy)**: 
  - [AP Calculus AB](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab) or 
  - [Calculus 1 / 2](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-1)
- **OpenStax “Precalculus” / “Calculus”**: Great free textbooks to supplement Khan Academy

# Tips for Success

1. **No Need for Every Exercise**: Practice enough to feel confident; skip ahead if it’s too easy.  
2. **Use Quizzes & Tests**: Each course has unit tests or mastery challenges for self-assessment.  
3. **Parallel Reading**: If you like books, read relevant sections in _OpenStax Precalculus_ alongside Khan Academy.  
4. **Pace Yourself**: Spend as much time as you need; consistency is key.  
5. **Supplemental Videos**: Whenever stuck, watch the associated lesson video on Khan Academy or a 3Blue1Brown video for more insight.

## Final Snapshot

1. **Arithmetic** → 2. **Pre-Algebra** → 3. **Algebra 1** → 4. **Geometry** → 5. **Algebra 2** → 6. **Trigonometry** → 7. **Precalculus**  
**Then** → _OpenStax Precalculus_ / _Linear Algebra_ / _Calculus_ → **ML & LLM Math**

By following this path, you’ll be well-prepared to handle the mathematics needed for machine learning, data science, and LLMs.
